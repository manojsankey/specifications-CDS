= Syntax Specification

The grammar and lexical specification for the standard GDL is entirely based on {openehr_odin}[openEHR ODIN syntax^], with a JSON equivalent, and driven by the guideline object model defined in this specification.

== Syntax Specification

The grammar and lexical specification for the expressions used by GDL is loosely based on the assertion syntax in the ADL specification. This grammar is implemented using javaCC specifications in the Java programming environment. The full source code of the java GDL parser is https://github.com/gdl-lang/gdl2/blob/master/src/main/javacc/expressions.jj[available here^].
