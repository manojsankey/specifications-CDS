== Requirements
This chapter describes detailed formal requirements of the GDL.

=== Clinical information models
* It shall be possible to express clinical logic using standards-based clinical models such as openEHR Archetypes or HL7 FHIR Resources both as input and output of the rule execution.
* The design shall support common data types underpinning standard clinical models.

=== Natural language support
* It shall be possible to author meta-data of the rules in any natural language.
* The rule expressions shall be independent of any natural language.
* The name of individual rules shall be independent of any natural language.
* It shall be possible to add multiple language translations without changing the logical definitions in the rules.

=== Reference terminology support
* It shall be possible to bind a locally defined term in the guideline to a single concept defined by one or several external reference terminologies.
* It shall be possible to bind a locally defined term in the guideline to multiple concepts defined by external reference terminologies.
* It shall be possible to bind a locally defined term in the guideline to terminology ref-sets defined externally.

=== Identification and meta-data
* Each rule shall be uniquely identified for a given name space.
* Each rule shall have explicit version information as part of the rule identification.
* There shall be sufficient meta-data about the guideline with regards to authorship, purpose of the rules, version information and relevant clinical references.

=== Rule Execution
* It shall be possible to chain the execution of several CDS rules in order to support complex decision making process.
* It shall be possible to reuse the CDS rules in different decision support applications in different clinical context.

=== Complex Output Objects
* It shall be possible to support complex hierarchical objects as output of the rule execution.
* It shall be possible to alter the structure of the output objects based on the rule executions.
* It shall be possible to alter the details of the output objects based on the rule executions.

=== Local variables
* It shall be possible to use locally defined variables to hold intermediate results of the rule execution.
* It shall be possible to use such local variables without dependent on external clinical models.

== Guide Object Model

=== Design background
openEHR archetypes are used both as input and output of GDL guidelines. This is the key to achieve natural language-independence and reference terminology-independence. Because of this design choice, openEHR specifications are reused substantially in the GDL design.

=== Packages Structure
The Guide Object Model, the object model of the GDL, consists of two packages, the guide package and the expressions package described in detail through the next two sections.

== Guide Package

=== Overview
The overview of the guide package is illustrated in Figure 1. Note that classes in blue color are loosely based on the original design from the openEHR specifications.

=== Syntax Specification
The grammar and lexical specification for the expressions used by GDL is loosely based on the assertion syntax in the ADL specification. This grammar is implemented using javaCC specifications in the Java programming environment.
The full source code of the java GDL parser can be found below.
