= Requirements

This section describes detailed formal requirements of the GDL2 language.

== Clinical information models

* It shall be possible to express clinical decision logic using standards-based clinical models such as openEHR Archetypes or HL7 FHIR Resources both as input and output of the rule execution;
* The design shall support common data types underpinning standard clinical models.

== Natural language independence

* It shall be possible to author meta-data of the rules in any natural language;
* The rule expressions shall be independent of any natural language;
* The name of individual rules shall be independent of any natural language;
* It shall be possible to add multiple language translations without changing the logical definitions in the rules.

== Reference terminology support

* It shall be possible to bind a locally defined term in the guideline to a single concept defined in one or several external reference terminologies;
* It shall be possible to bind a locally defined term in the guideline to multiple concepts defined by external reference terminologies;
* It shall be possible to bind a locally defined term in the guideline to externally defined terminology ref-sets.

== Identification and meta-data

* Each rule shall be uniquely identified for a given name space;
* Each rule shall have explicit version information as part of the guideline identifier;
* There shall be sufficient meta-data about the guideline with regards to authorship, purpose of the rules, version information and relevant clinical references.

== Rule Execution

* It shall be possible to chain the execution of several guidelines in order to support complex decision making process;
* It shall be possible to reuse the guidelines in different decision support applications in different clinical contexts.

== Complex Output Objects

* It shall be possible to support complex hierarchical objects as output of the rule execution;
* It shall be possible to alter the structure of the output objects based on the rule executions;
* It shall be possible to alter the details of the output objects based on the rule executions;
* It shall support standard or non-standard based output format.

== Local variables

* It shall be possible to use locally defined variables to hold intermediate results of the rule execution;
* It shall be possible to use such local variables without dependent on external clinical models.
