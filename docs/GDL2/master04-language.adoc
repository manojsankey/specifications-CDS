= GDL2 Semantics

== Rule Structure

The following diagram illustrates the structure of a GDL2 guideline. The central rules defining the semantics of the guideline are defined in terms of the formal rule definitions (when/then structures) coupled with 'rule execution filters', consisting of pre-conditions and predicates, that decide which rules are executed. If a rule is executed, its `when` conditions will be evaluated, and if all satisfied, its `then` actions performed. The data-bindings and terminology parts of structure define respectively, the mappings of the gt-codes used in the rules to nodes in input or output data sets (archetypes and/or templates); and the definitions of the gt-codes as terms, for human use. Finally, the optional `templates` provide a way of reporting generated results to downstream consumers. These are described in more detail in the <<Reporting>> section below.

== Execution Model

The following diagram illustrates the execution model of a rule in a GDL2 guideline, showing more clearly the relationship between rule execution 'filters' and rule execution.

== GDL2 Language Elements

=== Syntax

Because GDL2 guidelines are machine serialisations of the <<GDL2 Object Model>>, the syntax is mostly a direct consequence of the structure. Currently, either {openehr_odin}[openEHR ODIN^] or {json}[JSON^] syntax may be used. The exception is where expressions appear, which is within Assertion and Assignment statements, which as per the model, occur in `/pre_conditions`, `data_bindings[id]/predicates`, `rules[id]/when` statements, `rules[id]/then` actions, and Guideline `default_actions`.

The following subsections describe the expressions occurring in Assertion and Assignment statements. The former is a kind of statement that asserts the truth of a Boolean expression, while the latter is a programming-style assignment of an expression of any type to a variable of that type.

=== Pre-conditions

Pre-conditions (`GUIDELINE._pre_conditions_`) are part of the execution filter for the rules in a guideline. Pre-conditions apply to the guideline as a whole, i.e. all constituent rules and usually specify conditions on the type of patient / subject to which the guideline applies. Input data sets not satisfying the pre-conditions will cause a Guideline to be considered by the execution engine as not applying, and execution will pass to other guidelines or terminate.

The following shows a pre-condition used in the `CHA2DS2VASc_Score_calculation.v1.1.0` guideline. This says that the value of the `gt0121` variable (meaning: Atrial fibrillation), which is mapped to the path `/data[at0001]/items[at0035]` in the archetype `openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.chadsvas_diagnosis_review.v1` is 1, i.e. it is present.

The following pre-condition is from the `Coeliac_disease_alert.v2` guideline, expressed in JSON. The `gt0015` code is mapped in a similar way to a data point within a diagnosis review. In this case, it asserts that there is no Coeliac disease diagnosis, which is the logical pre-condition for applying a Coeliac risk analysis guideline (clearly the latter is not useful for subjects already diagnosed as Coeliac).

    "pre_conditions": [
      "$gt0015|Coeliac disease diagnosis| == null"
    ],

=== Rules

Rules consist of the pattern `when Assertion(s) then Statement(s)`. The logic of multiple Assertions in the `when` part is `and`, i.e. all are needed for the rule to fire. 

The following example is from the `Coeliac_disease_alert.v2` guideline, and shows a rule whose `when` condition is a multi-way `or` expression of various conditions, and whose `then` statements consist of:

* assignment to a variable from an output template that corresponds to a CDS hooks 'card' data item;
* call to a procedure `use_template` that tells the execution engine which reporting template to use.

This kind of rule essentially reports on a Boolean condition that was found to be present in the input data.

Rules may be used to perform calculations, such as the well-known Body Mass Index (BMI). The extract below is from the `BMI_Calculation-FHIR.v1` guideline. The 3rd item in the `then` list is an assignment stating that the BMI variable `gt0003` value should be set to weight (`gt0007`) / height(`gt0005`)^2.

=== Expression Elements

Most expression terminal elements shown in the <<Expressions Package>> below are generated during the process of parsing larger expressions and statements found within guidelines, as per the above examples. Consequently, some properties, such as types of constants and variables are inferred and generated on the fly, rather than being stated literally within a guideline.

=== Local Variables

Local variables identified by gt-codes may be defined by including their gt-code definitions in the `terminology` in the normal way, and then just using them within assertions and assignments. They are tracked in the list `GUIDELINE_DEFINITION.internal_variables`, which is constructed on the fly during guideline materialisation.
