= Design Overview

openEHR archetypes are used both as input and output of GDL guidelines. This is the key to achieve natural language-independence and reference terminology-independence. Because of this design choice, openEHR specifications are reused substantially in the GDL design.

== Package Structure

The Guideline Object Model, the object model of the GDL, consists of three packages, the `guideline` package, `expression` package and the `terminology` package, each described in detail through the following sections.
