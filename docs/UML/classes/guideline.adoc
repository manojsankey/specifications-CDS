a|TBD: I wonder if we should just reference the AM Terminology class here for now - it makes it easy to show re-use; or do you prefer just to make a local custom one for now? I have done it using a ref to AM::ARCHETYPE_TERMINOLOGY just to show how it looks. I think this could be better from a spec POV, I would not change anything in your impl, it is close enough.
